                Every day for one month, I crocheted as close to my height as I could within a two-minute time limit. At the end of those 30 days, I designed a woven reflection considering body width measurements. The pieces created from those measurements were lasercut. This was the first work I ever sold.

        <h3>About the Creator</h3>
        <p id="about-me">
            STEM was a foundational structure of my childhood, but I didn't find a fitting form of self-expression in the environment. I sought a BFA in Fiber Arts and Textiles from SCAD (received 2019) which has aided in personal development and expression. Then, I decided I could live in both worlds. I searched for a career in the tech industry so that I might acquire the skills to host an online gallery space for physical and virtual artforms. Currently, I work as a fledgling developer for a great company called Welland Co., Inc.
