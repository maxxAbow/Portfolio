        <p>STEM was a foundational structure of my childhood, but I didn't find a fitting form of self-expression in the environment. I sought a BFA in Fiber Arts and Textiles from SCAD (received 2019) which has aided in personal development and expression. Then, I decided I could live in both worlds. I searched for a career in the tech industry so that I might acquire the skills to host an online gallery space for physical and virtual artforms. Currently, I work as a fledgling developer for a great company called Welland Co., Inc.</p>
